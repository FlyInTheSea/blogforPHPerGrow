attack is skillful while defend is easy.

The way to defend from sqlInject has been declared in "http://www.phptherightway.com/#pdo_extension"

More importantly, PDO allows you to safely inject foreign input (e.g. IDs) into your SQL queries 
without worrying about database SQL injection attacks. 
This is possible using PDO statements and bound parameters.





I think there is another solution;
if the param is int then use intval($param);
if the param is string then use addslashes($param) or like this
$param = bin2hex($param);
$sql = "select * from admin where name = UNHEX(0x".$param .")";
