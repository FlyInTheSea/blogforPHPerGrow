So what do I do when clipboard stops working?

Luckily fixing the issue is pretty straightforward and involves a few simple steps.

Load up task manager (right click taskbar and select Task Manager)
Go to the Processes Tab
Select rdpclip.exe
Click End Process
Go to the Application Tab
Click New Process
Type rdpclip
Click Ok

It happens so often, this process is annoying! What do I do to fix it permanently?

Unfortunately I don’t know why rdpclip stops working nor how to fix it permanently;
however,there is a way to make it easier if it happens often.

Create a new bat file and call it whatever you want say, clipboard.bat.
Write the following two commands on separate lines in the new bat file
Taskkill.exe /im rdpclip.exe
Rdpclip.exe
Save the bat file and drag it into the toolbar quick launch section
Now whenever your copy and paste operation fails to restore it,
all you need to do is click this new batch file which will kill rdpclip and restart it.
Still a workaround but at least it’s a quick procedure
