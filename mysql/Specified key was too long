PS: The INT(1) and INT(32) data types indicates another misunderstanding about MySQL
 The numeric argument has no effect related to storage or the range of values allowed for the column
INT is always 4 bytes, and it always allows values from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
The numeric argument is about padding values during display
which has no effect unless you use the ZEROFILL option.
