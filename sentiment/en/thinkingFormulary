I went to an interview yesterday ;
There was a question that asked you to recursively delete files in given directory ;
Of course you can solve the question in the way that offered in http://php.net/manual/en/function.rmdir.php#110489

There is another way offered in http://php.net/manual/en/function.rmdir.php#118821

I seldom use the second way before .
I think i should chang my mind 

If you let me design a system maybe IM for example ,
i will make everything ok except the function of remote control.
because i can't implement it ;




Another example , if a phper don't familiar with hadoop then how can you accomplish the function of tags system ;


more tools , more way;
